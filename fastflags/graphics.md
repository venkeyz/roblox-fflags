### Move Pre-Render Phase [~25 Performance Boost]
added by @pixelyloaf
==- :icon-question: View Full Documentation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This FastFlag moves the Pre-Render task to an off thread after all other tasks are completed. By default, Pre-Render runs first, forcing the render thread to wait until the Pre-Render process finishes before it can start rendering a frame.

> [!NOTE]
> With this FastFlag enabled, Pre-Renderer is executed while the main thread is processing the previous frame. This adjustment allows the main thread to proceed without waiting for Pre-Renderer, leading to increased framerates at the expense of some frame latency.

> [!TIP]
> This flag is most effective in CPU-bound scenarios.

> [!CAUTION]
> Enabling this FastFlag may lead to input lag & crashes
