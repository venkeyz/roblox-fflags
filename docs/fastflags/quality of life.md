### MTU
added by @pixelyloaf
==- :icon-question: View Full Documentation
> [!TIP]
> **Identify the Current MTU**
> - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and type 'netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces`.
> - **Linux**: Use 'ifconfig' or 'ip link show' to find the current MTU of your network interface.

> [!TIP]
> **Determine the Optimal MTU**
> - **Ping Test**: Use the `ping` command with the `-f` flaf (to avoid fragmentation) and the `l` (or `s` on Linux) flag to set the global packet size.
> - **Example for Windows**:
> ```bash
> ping roblox.com -f -l 1472
> ```
> - **Example for Linux**:
> ```bash
> ping -s 1472 -M do roblox.com
> ```
> - Start with a packet size of 1472 bytes, then reduce by 10-12 bytes if needed until you find the largest size that doesn't fragment. Add 28 bytes to this number to get the optimal MTU.

### Increased Asset Preloading Count
added by @pixelyloaf
==- :icon-question: View Full Documentation
> [!NOTE]
> **Increasing the maximum limit of preloaded assets from 100 to infinite allows games you've already played to load much faster by instantly accessing previously loaded assets.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **For this to be effective, the game must have been fully loaded at least once, preferably with the entire map cached.**

> [!TIP]
> **If a game has a "Skip Loading" button, it's recommended to use it. These games typically include a countdown timer that, after reaching zero, merely confirms that all assets are loaded.**
